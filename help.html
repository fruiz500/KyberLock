    <h3>What is KyberLock?</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="helpText">
    <p>Before you do anything else, you may want to watch this three-minute video, which explains the essential concepts in a lighthearted way for a very similar app named PassLok (warning: watching it may leak your IP number): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxgrES_CGcg" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxgrES_CGcg</a></p>
    <ul>
      <li>KyberLock locks text and files, and sets up secure real time chat sessions using strong <strong>end-to-end encryption</strong>.</li>
      <li>KyberLock is based on Crystals-Kyber, the new standard for quantum-proof cryptography. Data encrypted today with KyberLock <strong>will remain secure</strong> when quantum computers become powerful enough to break all other kinds of encryption.</li>
      <li>KyberLock uses Keys and Locks. You encrypt something with <strong>someone else's Lock</strong>, so only that person can decrypt it with his/her secret Key.</li>
      <li>Your secret Key is a short piece of text, which <strong>can be anything you want so you can remember it</strong>.</li>
      <li>The matching Lock is then made from your Key. It is impossible to get the Key from the Lock.</li>
      <li>You should never give your secret Key to anyone. Your Lock, however, is meant to be distributed freely.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This approach has a number of advantages over other privacy apps that you may be familiar with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>KyberLock does not involve a server, so nobody can possibly have your private data.</li>
      <li>The same code runs on computers, phones, and tablets to make it perfectly portable.</li>
      <li>You can use KyberLock alongside your favorite email, texting app, or any program by cut and paste.</li>
      <li>KyberLock does not need to store anything secret. The only secret is your Key, which stays in your head.</li>
      <li>You can use KyberLock with a public or borrowed device as easily and safely as with your private phone or computer.</li>
      <li>Several users (or several identities) can coexist on the same device.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>KyberLock is <strong>still in experimental phase</strong> since there has not been enough time for security experts to uncover possible flaws. Bear this in mind before entrusting critical secrets to it.</p>

    <h3>Invite others to KyberLock</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="helpText">
    <p>Before you can communicate with others using KyberLock, they must have obtained the app, come up with a secret Key (which they won't tell you), generated a Lock from it, and sent it back to you.</p>
    <p>You can tell others about KyberLock any way you want, but KyberLock can help you to start your network with a single keystroke, this way:</p>
    <p>1. Optionally, type a message in the main box. Don't write anything sensitive, since <strong>invitation messages are not secure</strong>.</p>
    <p>2. Click the <strong>Invite</strong> button.</p>
    <p>3. If something was written, you will be asked to confirm, and then the main box will be filled with some instructions and some gibberish that you can send to those you want to invite. This gibberish contains your Lock and the (insecurely) encrypted message.</p>
    <p>4. If now you click the Email button, a new page should open in your default email, containing that rext. Edit it as needed, then write the recipients' email addresses and send it.</p>
    <p>This is explained in this video tutorial for PassLok, which is very similar (warning: watching it may leak your IP number): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wTJWyd9s64" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wTJWyd9s64</a></p>

    <h3>How to make a strong Key</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="helpText">
    <p>You should be able to <strong>remember your secret Key</strong> without having to write it down. KyberLock does not store the Key anywhere. In fact, it deletes it from memory after five minutes of not being used.</p>
    <p>As you type your Key, KyberLock displays a color-coded message telling you how strong it is. If you stop typing for a second, a mnemonic &quot;Hashili&quot; word based on your Key is displayed right under the strength score, to reassure you that you have typed the Key correctly, even if you cannot see it. Clicking the eye icon reveals the entire Key.</p>
    <p>Your Key will be stronger if it contains <strong>caPiTals</strong> in unusual places, <strong>numb3rs</strong>, and <strong>$ymbol$</strong>. If you use common words, <strong>miespell</strong> them to make a "dictionary attack" hader. Break the words up with <strong>num334bers</strong> and <strong>sy#$%mbols</strong>. Avoid anything that might be easy to guess. KyberLock knows frequently used words, but hackers' dictionaries are bigger. Do not use grammatically correct sentences, even if KyberLock gives a big score.</p>
    <p>KyberLock <strong>compensates for weak Keys by adding spurious computations</strong> and may even appear to have crashed. If KyberLock is slow, this may be because your Key strength is less than Medium.</p>
    <p>This and more is explained in this video tutorial for the very similar PassLok app (warning: watching it may leak your IP number): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbNM_cf8My0" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbNM_cf8My0</a></p>

    </div>
    <div class="helpText">
      <p>If you plan to use KyberLock only with shared Keys, you do not need a secret Key at all. Simply Cancel when you are asked for your Key when KyberLock starts, and write or paste the encryption Key into the lower box that appears when you you click the <strong>Edit</strong> button located next to the directory.</p>
      <p>If instead of a short shared Key you paste in a piece or text at least five times as long as the message to be encrypted, KyberLock uses it in Pad mode, which theoretically is much more secure than the regular mode (more on this in a help item below).</p>
    </div>

  <div class="helpHeading">
    <h3>Get a hint to remember my Key</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="helpText">
    <p>If you are reading this, likely you have gained Guest access to KyberLock by clicking <strong>Cancel</strong> at the Key entry screen. The good news is that you can still encrypt messages if you know the recipient's Lock or shared Key, verify signatures, and use the Locks stored in your local directory as well as all the auxiliary functions of KyberLock. You can even seal items and display the matching Lock if you enter a Key when KyberLock asks for it.</p>
    <p>The bad news is that  you cannot change anything stored in the local directory, and your use of it is limited to Locks. You cannot do anything that would involve your secret Key, such as decrypting messages encrypted with your Lock, or continuing a Read-once conversation in course.</p>
    <p>Well, we've got even worse news for you: we cannot help you to recover your secret Key, because KyberLock never stored it or sent it out. There are no saved hints, either. If you forgot your Key, <strong>it's gone, along with all encrypted items in the local directory</strong>.</p>
    <p>But chances are you <em>almost</em> remember it, and are off only by a few characters. When you stop typing in the Key entry box, a mnemonic &quot;Hashili&quot; word derived from it appears right above it. Perhaps you can recognize the correct Hashili word when you see it, which will help you to reconstruct your Key. For your security, the Hashili word alone is not enough to reconstruct the Key.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="helpText">
      <p>Hopefully Guest mode will let you get by until you remember your secret Key. But if you want to get full access to KyberLock with a new Key, here are the steps:</p>
      <p>1. Go to the <strong>Options</strong> tab.</p>
      <p>2. Click the Backup/Remove <strong>Options only</strong> box. When a popup asks for confirmation to delete your settings, click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
      <p>3. Reload KyberLock.</p>
      <p>4. The user selection screen will appear, and this time KyberLock will accept whatever new Key and email or suchlike you want to give it for the user in question. Now you're back in business and can use KyberLock with the new Key to seal, decrypt, store items in the local directory, etc.</p>
      <p>At this point, the only directory entry that will work fully is &quot;myself&quot;. You can reset or delete the entries that don't work one by one, by typing each name in the directory Edit dialog and clicking <strong>Reset</strong> (leave essential data intact) or <strong>Delete</strong> (take out everything) when the name is recognized, or all at once by following the process described in a help item below, about &quot;moving the entire local directory.&quot;</p>
    </div>

  <div class="helpHeading">
    <h3>Use a different Key temporarily</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="helpText">
    <p>For a given user name, there is only one &quot;secret Key&quot; that unlocks all the capabilities of KyberLock, but if you are willing to accept a limited access to its functions, you can use a different Key for the session, or whenever KyberLock asks you for the Key. This way:</p>
    <p>1. Select the user and enter the new Key in the box (optional).</p>
    <p>2. Click the <strong>Cancel</strong> button.</p>
    <p>3. If asked for your email etc., enter it and click <strong>OK</strong>. (the <strong>Random</strong> button will write a new random value, different from the original random token, if any, so beware)</p>
    <div class="helpHeading2">
      <p><em>Click here for More:</em></p>
    </div>
    <div class="helpText">
      <p>You can do pretty much everything, except things that would have involved the secret Key. You cannot modify anything in the local directory. When you reload KyberLock and enter the correct Key, a warning will tell you that last session was run in Guest mode. If you don't select a user from the list, you won't have access to any stored Locks.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="helpHeading">
    <h3>Make KyberLock even more secure</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="helpText">
    <p>When you first opened KyberLock, you were asked to optionally enter your email or similar public, easy to recall personal information. But if instead of entering your email you click the <strong>Random</strong> button next to the input box, an 43-character random token is used. This makes your Lock  much harder to crack, but it becomes tied to the device where it was created  (except for the Chrome and Firefox extensions, which can sync it across devices).</p>
    <p>To back up your random token to a safe place in case of accidental deletion or to be able to use a different device:</p>
    <p>1. Click the Backup/Remove <strong>Options only</strong> button on the <strong>Options</strong> tab (visible in the Advanced interface). A backup item appears on the main box, from where you can save it to file, copy it, email it, etc.</p>
    <p>2. Then a dialog asks you if you want to reset your settings. If you click <strong>OK</strong>, KyberLock will restart as if it had never started before, except that the local directory remains intact.</p>
    <p>To restore the random token from a backup item, paste the packup into the main box and click <strong>Decrypt</strong>.</p>
    <p>This and more is explained in this video tutorial made for the very similar PassLok app (warning: watching it may leak your IP number): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DjhIjU_nuM" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DjhIjU_nuM</a></p>
    <div class="helpHeading2">
      <p><em>Click here for More:</em></p>
    </div>
    <div class="helpText">
      <p>The reason for the email or other additional data is to combat the &quot;rainbow table&quot; attack, where hackers pre-compute Locks made from the words in a dictionary. This data is encrypted and stored along with other settings, so you won't need to enter it again. The Lock depends both on the Key and the email or random token; this adds extra security, but it also means that if the random token gets erased you will not be able to decrypt anything that was encrypted with your Lock. The backup item contains your settings, including the random token, encrypted by your secret Key. One reason to delete your settings while leaving the local directory intact is to be able to change the random token to a new value. You can also proceed without entering any email or token.</p>
      <p>If you plan to use KyberLock for Email or KyberLock Universal, it is best if you write your real email in this box, for in this case your KyberLock Lock will be identical to the one used in those apps and you'll be able to use their main features interchangeably. This precaution is not necessary if you only use one of the versions.</p>

    <p>Click the <strong>myLock</strong> button on the <strong>Main</strong> tab. The Lock matching that Key will appear
      in the lower box, from where you can copy it or email it.</p>
    <p>The message area above it will also display the Lock's fingerprint, a 50-character string that you should send to people who receive your Lock, by a different channel such as dictating it over the phone or video, so they can confirm that the Lock they received actually came from you. 
    </p>

      <p>If you need to make a Lock for a different Key, it is best if you start KyberLock in Guest mode by clicking <strong>Cancel</strong> when you are first asked for your Key, which will make KyberLock accept a different Key.

  </div>
  <div class="helpText">
    <p>From the <strong>Main</strong> tab (this works only for Locks):</p>
    <p>1. Paste the Lock into the Main box. Only the gibberish text between the header and the footer is needed, but there's no problem copying those as well. If the item is identified as a Lock, a prompt will ask you to give it a name. It will also display the Lock's 50-character fingerprint.</p>
    <p>2. If you received the fingerprint by a separate trusted channel, check that it is the same as displayed. Otherwise make a note to check it as soon as possible.</p>
    <p>3. Write a name in the prompt box and click <strong>OK</strong>. You will see the name added to the selection box at the top of the <strong>Main</strong> tab.</p>
    <p>From the directory Edit dialog:</p>
    <p>1. Cick the <strong>Edit</strong> button next to the directory box.</p>
    <p>2. Paste the Lock or shared Key in the box, replacing whatever was there before. Usually KyberLock will recognize a Lock and display a message saying so, along with its fingerprint.</p>
    <p>3. If you received the fingerprint by a separate trusted channel, check that it is the same as displayed. Otherwise make a note to check it as soon as possible.</p>
    <p>4. Click the <strong>Save</strong> button. A popup will ask you to provide a name for the item.</p>
    <p>5. Write the name and click <strong>OK</strong>. A message confirms that the item has been saved under the name given.</p>

      <p>Authenticating Locks is very important for security. Otherwise an interloper will be able to impersonate the authentic sender. If you did not have the authentic Lock's fingerprint when you entered it, you can display it later by typing the Lock's given name in the directory Edit box. If the fingerprint does not match what you've got, you can delete the Lock by clicking <strong>Delete</strong> at this point.</p>
      <p>If the given name is already in the directory, the Lock or shared Key will be replaced rather than added. You can store a cover text or a List besides an individual's Lock or shared Key. In the case of a List, the given name will be displayed bracketed by double dashes. Items that are not Locks are stored encrypted.</p>
      <p>(<em>Chrome/Firefox app only</em>) If <strong>Chrome sync</strong> is checked in Options, the item will also be added to the Chrome sync area, so it is available on a different computer after you log into Chrome or Firefox.</p>

      <p>You must be aware that being able to unseal an item does not mean that others are not able to do it just as easily, because a sealed item is <strong>NOT ENCRYPTED</strong>. What unsealing does is verify that the item could only have been sealed by the selected person.</p>

      <p>1. Check that the item to be converted into fake text is on the <strong>Main</strong> tab. Then click the <strong>&#9660;</strong> button, if needed, to show the <strong>Text hide</strong> button.</p>
      <p>2. If you wish to use a cover text different from the default and you have stored it in the local directory, select it on the top box of the <strong>Main</strong> tab. Otherwise click the <strong>Edit</strong> button and enter the new cover text in the dialog, then return to the <strong>Main</strong> tab.</p>
      <p>3. Make sure the hiding mode you want is the one selected in the <strong>Options</strong> tab. There are five different modes: Invisible, Letters, Words, Spaces, and Sentences. Letters (default) encodes the item as identical-looking non-ASCII characters in the cover text, so the text still reads normally. Words replaces each character by two words. Spaces encodes the characters into the spaces between words. Sentences encodes characters as grammatically correct sentences. Invisible mode encodes into invisible characters between two lines, which can then be completed to look like a normal message.</p>
      <p>4. If now you click the <strong>Text hide</strong> button, the KyberLock item is converted into text, using words from the cover text. You may have to complete the last sentence manually.</p>

        <p>The recipient does not need to have the cover text in order to retrieve the original. The output of Spaces and Sentences encoding is roughly six times longer than that of Letters or Words encoding. The most grammatically-correct output is that or Letters and Spaces (identical to the cover text), followed by Sentences; Words output doesn't make much grammatical sense. Invisible encoding has no impact on intelligibility, but care must be taken to copy the entire invisible content. If the cover text is not long enough, it will be repeated several times. When you use Spaces or Letters encoding, you should be careful not to add or delete any spaces within the encoded text, but it is okay to add a few extra letters to complete the last sentence. Also be aware that some services replace the special characters in Letters- and Invisible-encoded items with something else, thus corrupting the items.</p>
        <p>Text encoding is no substitute for real encryption, and so KyberLock will refuse to convert into text anything that does not look like genuine KyberLock output.</p>
        <p>Cover texts do not have to be in English or even use Latin characters. Anything that can be written in UTF-16 encoded characters can be used (most languages, including Arabic and Chinese, will work fine).</p>
        <p>You can store often-used cover texts in your local directory so they can be loaded easily from the <strong>Main</strong> tab. To do this, click the <strong>Edit</strong> button next to the directory box when the <strong>Text Hide</strong>button is showing, then paste the cover text in the lower box, and click <strong>Save</strong>.

Copy the parts one by one and send or store them as needed.</p>

      <h3>Authenticate a Lock without using videos <em>(advanced)</em></h3>

      <p>The easy way: call the Lock's owner and ask him/her to read a substantial portion of the Lock's fingerprint over the phone. But if you are communicating exclusively by email you can send a person whom you know and who knows you the following message, or something like it:</p>
      <p><br>
        <em>Dear So-and-So:</em><br>
        <em>I just obtained your KyberLock Lock from (cite source), but I still wonder if it is authentic since I am unable to view the authenticating video that you may have made for it. Therefore, I ask you to help me authenticate it through the interlock protocol. Here's what I want you to do:</em></p>
      <ol>
        <li><em>Write a message asking me to take a picture or video of myself doing something of your choice. Encrypt the message with my Lock, which is appended to this message, and copy it to a safe place. Then split it in two and send me the first half only.</em></li>
        <li><em>When I receive your first half, I will also write a message asking you to do something in a picture or short video. I'll encrypt that message with your Lock, and I'll send you half of the encrypted message first. When you get it, go ahead and send me the other half of your encrypted message.</em></li>
        <li><em>When I get your second half, I'll put the two halves together and decrypt your message. Then, following your instructions I'll send you the picture or video right away, decrypted, along with the second half of my encrypted request.</em></li>
        <li><em>When you get it, please verify that what I sent conforms to your instructions. If so, put together the two halves of my encrypted message to you, decrypt it, and send me what I ask in the message as soon as possible, decrypted as well. Then I'll know that your Lock is authentic.</em></li>

      <div class="helpText">
        <p>Alternatively, you can ask the other person to use KyberLock's built-in <strong>Split/Join</strong> function, explained in another help item, rather than simply cutting messages in two. The pictures or videos (or recordings) don't need to be encrypted. Only the instructions for making them need to be encrypted and transmitted with this two-step process. There is an article in the <a href="http://PassLok.weebly.com/uploads/2/4/1/8/24187628/PassLok_manual21.pdf" target="_blank">PassLok manual</a> that explains how this protocol works for authenticating Locks.</p>

    <h3>Check the authenticity of the code</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="helpText">
    <p>If you got KyberLock from an app store, that app store is ensuring that the code you have is what the author gave to them. The following is to check the integrity of the web app version of KyberLock running in a browser:</p>
    <p>1. Direct your browser to "save page as" and "HTML only" if your browser supports it. Alternatively, you can go to Online-convert (https://hash.online-convert.com/sha256-generator) and type the URL of your version of KyberLock there, then skip step 2.</p>
    <p>2. Now you have to take the SHA256 checksum of the code using a program different from KyberLock. You have several options:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use a local program or online utility to take the checksum of the source saved to a file.</li>
      <li>Use an online utility where you paste the text on a box and click a button. You must make sure that pasting does not add extra space at the top or the bottom of the file, which would affect the result. Links to good ones are below.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>3. Look up the checksum for this version of KyberLock, which is published on the KyberLock information website at KyberLock.com and a number of other places, plus near the end of this help file. If this value and the one obtained above are not the same, the program has been tampered with. Here are some places where this information is published:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>KyberLock information page: <a href="https://KyberLock.com" target="_blank">https://KyberLock.com</a></li>
      <li>PR Gomez.com (author's blog): <a href="https://prgomez.com/current-version-of-kyberlock" target="_blank">https://prgomez.com/current-version-of-kyberlock/</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>4. Now, a hacker who could alter the source code at the server might also be able to change the published checksums so they match the tampered code. To make sure that the value is authentic you should watch the one-minute video where the author or KyberLock, Francisco Ruiz, reads the SHA256 checksum aloud. A link to the video usually accompanies the published SHA256 value.</p>
    <p>This and more is explained in this video tutorial for the very similar PassLok app (warning: watching it may leak your IP number): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrAfSo2xjnY" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrAfSo2xjnY</a></p>

    <div class="helpText">
      <p>SHA256 is built into the OS in Linux and OSX, not so in Windows, but there are free programs available, such as Checksum Utility and Bitser. There are also online utilities where you can upload a file and get the hash. Online-convert (https://hash.online-convert.com/sha256-generator), fileformat.info (https://fileformat.info/tool/hash.htm) have worked well in our tests.</p>
      <p>If you want a clipboard-based SHA256 utility, the one at Xorbin (https://www.xorbin.com/tools/sha256-hash-calculator) has worked quite well in our tests. Don't copy and paste from Chrome, since this introduces artifacts.</p>

    <h3>Privacy Policy and Warrant Canary</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="helpText">
    <p><strong>Data we collect:</strong> Nothing. No cookies or anything of that sort. We don't even have the means to know who has downloaded the app.</p>
    <p><strong>How we use this data:</strong> Nothingness brings us closer to Nirvana. It's quite a liberation.</p>
    <p><strong>What data we share:</strong> Everything we have from you, that is, absolutely nothing. This way we don't need expensive servers and our bills are small, plus we cannot compromise your precious data. Here's wishing that so many other providers would do likewise.</p>
    <p>Concerning truly private data:</p>
    <p><strong>1. We cannot give your secret Key to anyone</strong> (not even yourself) because we don't have it. Your Key is never stored or transmitted, and by default gets deleted from memory after five minutes of not being used.</p>
    <p><strong>2. We cannot give your private data to anyone</strong> because KyberLock does not send anything out of your device. When you download the app from its server, you get only the code, without any cookies, plugins, or anything of that sort.</p>
    <p><strong>3. We cannot eavesdrop on your chat sessions, or enable anyone to do so.</strong> Establishing a chat session does involve contacting a signaling server and giving it your IP address and a disposable chatroom name so that others can contact you; the signaling server never sees the content of your chat, which is between participants only. The KyberLock web server doesn't even see the connection data.</p>
    <p><strong>4. We will never weaken the cryptography methods contained within KyberLock at the request of a third party, private or public.</strong> This also means no backdoors will ever be added. We would rather discontinue KyberLock than be forced to do this, which would betray the very essence of our efforts. If we learn that counterfeit versions of KyberLock are circulating, whether placed by hackers or government agencies, we will make the fact known to users.</p>
    <p><strong>Notice:</strong> Since KyberLock is distributed as a piece of human-readable code, we consider it an expression of free speech protected by the laws of many countries. Putting into circulation tampered versions of KyberLock, whether by individuals or public entities, violates free speech and copyright protection laws.</p>
    <p>KyberLock contains strong cryptographic methods, which may be illegal to use in some countries. Please check the local laws before using KyberLock.</p>
